Limb Gallery is a responsive gallery plugin for displaying images and videos in multiple beautiful layouts. 

== Description ==

Limb Gallery lets you make beautiful photo and video galleries with responsive layouts and customizable styles. The process of the photo and video gallery creation is very easy and enjoyable due to its high speed and the fact that the main actions of the plugin, such as adding images and preview images are animated movements. Limb Gallery has 5 different views for the gallery layout and 3 views for the album layout. 

Moreover, one gallery can be published multiple times with different themes and options and you can also collapse them into the albums and publish them, too. The plugin has a single page admin which enables you to control everything just from one single page. It also has a very functional built-in uploader which accelerates the process of the gallery and album creation with the help of its advanced functions, such as uploading, renaming, deleting images and creating folders. Finally, Limb Gallery has a very important characteristic which is the opportunity to choose the exact pro-features of the plugin that you need without purchasing the others. <br>
